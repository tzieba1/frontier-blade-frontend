## Testing

### Vitest for Unit/Component Tests

- Use Vitest to test the logic inside individual components and Vuex modules.
- This includes testing individual Vue components, Vuex store mutations, actions, getters, and small interactions that donâ€™t involve external systems like APIs or the router.
- Vitest works well with libraries like @testing-library/vue to test component rendering and interaction without needing a full browser environment.

### Cypress for E2E Tests

- Use Cypress for user interaction and integration testing.
- Cypress will simulate how users navigate this app, test form submissions, API interactions, authentication, and other critical flows.
- This helps ensure that the application behaves as expected from a user's perspective.
